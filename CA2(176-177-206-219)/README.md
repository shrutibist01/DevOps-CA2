## Assignment Breakdown

### **Step 1 â€“ Deployment Strategy (1 Mark)**
- Tool: **GitHub Actions**
- Implemented a working CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy the Rasoi-Genie service automatically.
- Workflow file stored under `.github/workflows/`.
- Includes a **pipeline diagram** explaining the automation process.

---

### **Step 2 â€“ Configuration Management & IaC (2 Marks)**
- Tool: **Ansible**
- Configures the runtime environment (installing Node.js, dependencies, users, and app setup).
- Includes:
  - `ansible/playbook.yml`
  - `ansible/inventory.txt`
- Demonstrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** for consistent environment setup.

---

### **Step 3 â€“ Containerization & Orchestration (1.5 Marks)**
- Tool: **Docker + Kubernetes**
- Backend and frontend services are Dockerized.
- Kubernetes manifests are located in the `k8s` folder.
- Demonstrates **rolling updates** and **rollback strategies**.
- Includes screenshots and YAML configurations for:
  - Deployment
  - Services
  - Namespace setup

---

### **Step 4 â€“ Monitoring & Logging (2 Marks)**
- Tools: **Prometheus + Grafana**
- Configured monitoring stack with:
  - `prometheus-deployment-service.yaml`
  - `grafana-deploy.yaml`
  - `node-exporter.yaml`
- Grafana dashboard displays:
  - Uptime
  - CPU & Memory Usage
  - Error Rates
  - Request Latency
- Dashboard screenshot included in the documentation.

---

### **Step 5 â€“ Reflection & Report (1.5 Marks)**
- **Documentation Folder** includes:
  - `project_ss.pdf` â€“ Report covering architecture, CI/CD pipeline, challenges, and lessons learned.
  - `presentation.pptx` â€“ Final slides for evaluation.
- Focuses on **DevOps pipeline flow**, **architecture**, and **team reflections**.

---

### **Step 6 â€“ Bonus (Kaggle Challenge)**
- Challenge: **Store Sales â€“ Time Series Forecasting (Kaggle)**
- Proof of participation and leaderboard screenshots stored in `Kaggle-Comp/`.
- Achieved successful submission and leaderboard ranking.
