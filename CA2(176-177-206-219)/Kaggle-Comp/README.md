This notebook presents a simple yet effective baseline model for the **[Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)** competition.  

---

## Problem Statement

The goal of this competition is to **predict daily sales** for different product families across multiple Favorita stores located in Ecuador.

Participants are provided with historical sales data that includes:
- Store and product identifiers  
- Promotion information  
- Dates and sales values  

The task is to build a model that can accurately forecast sales for a **15-day period following the end of the training data**.  
Predictions must be submitted in the form of a `submission.csv` file containing the expected sales for each `(store_nbr, family, date)` combination in the test set.

Accurate forecasting will help **Corporaci√≥n Favorita** improve inventory management, demand planning, and promotional strategies.

## Approach

A **median-based forecasting model** was used as a starting point:

1. Compute the **median sales** per `(store_nbr, family)` (or extended groups) using the `train` dataset.  
2. Merge these medians with the `test` data.  
3. Fill missing values using appropriate fallbacks (e.g., median by store+family+day_of_week, then global median).  
4. Evaluate performance using **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)** on a time-based validation split.

This serves as a simple yet strong baseline for further experimentation.
